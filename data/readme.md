This dataset is a compilation of web pages providing information about research data management for some institutions in Germany. 
Features of the datasets
* Several institutions propose FAQs that look similar.
* For some institutions, rdm info can be found on one page (mostly), for others, it is spread over several pages. In this case, only one website is selected for illustration purposes.
* Some institutions have information available in German, but not in English. These were not included in the dataset for now.
* Sometimes many departments of the same institutions are relevant. Only one website (the central university website) is used for all.

The search was done between October 11th and October 18th, 2023.

ToDo
* expand the dataset with systematic information about the description of their service offer (consulting/training, etc). Challenge: the description is non-homogeneous (sometimes present, sometimes absent).
* expand the dataset to incorporate all rdm pages when several are available. Challenge: the structuring of the websites is heterogeneous.
* make the dataset bilingual.
